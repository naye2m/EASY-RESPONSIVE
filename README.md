# EASY-RESPONSIVE
Simple way to make websites responsive (for noobs).


just add the following code to the head section of your HTML document:

if avaiable, use the following code:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
This is the main focus of this project. It sets the viewport to the width of the device and sets the initial scale to 1.0, which means that the page will be zoomed out to fit the screen.
if viewport meta is unable to be used, use the following code in head tag:
```html
<!-- css tag -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naye2m/EASY-RESPONSIVE/refs/heads/main/easy-responsive.css">
<!-- js tag -->
 <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naye2m/EASY-RESPONSIVE/refs/heads/main/easy-responsive.js"></script>
```
